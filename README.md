# final-project-custom-store

Have you seen the iPhone X where you can log in with your face and not a passcode?

That was my inspiration for this project, I saw that facial recognition is a key priority for many major tech companies so I wanted to build something that utilised image recognition for facial authentification.

This project uses advanced facial and image recognition software to provide a facial authentification process. In simpler words, users can signup and login with just a username and a picture of their face which can be taken from a camera built into the webpage or a selfie from their mobile.

Once a user signs up, the signup photo is analysed for gender, age, etc. This data is then used to create a completely personalised collection when the user is logged in. 

Every single user is presented with a unique collection of clothes based on data taken from their facial signup.
